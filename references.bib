@article{Buonanno2002Signal,
    abstract = {{Using the force-susceptibility formalism of linear quantum measurements, we study the dynamics of signal recycled interferometers, such as LIGO-II. We show that, although the antisymmetric mode of motion of the four arm-cavity mirrors is originally described by a free mass, when the signal-recycling mirror is added to the interferometer, the radiation-pressure force not only disturbs the motion of that  ” free mass” randomly due to quantum fluctuations, but also, and more fundamentally, makes it respond to forces as though it were connected to a spring with a specific optical-mechanical rigidity. This oscillatory response gives rise to a much richer dynamics than previously known for SR interferometers, which enhances the possibilities for reshaping the noise curves and, if thermal noise can be pushed low enough, enables the standard quantum limit to be beaten. We also show the possibility of using servo systems to suppress the instability associated with the optical-mechanical interaction without compromising the sensitivity of the interferometer.}},

In particular, the effects of modulation on signal and noise in interferometers are discussed. It is seen that the mixing in of quantum noise from different modes of the vacuum can degrade the signal-to-noise ratio of a measurement in a variety of apparently different physical situations. Michelson interferometers with both internal and external phase modulation are specifically considered, but the results are easily extendable to any type of interferometer. We also comment upon some implications for the use of squeezing in interferometers. For examples, we argue that it is possible, even in lossy narrow-band interferometers, for squeezing to reduce significantly the effective quantum-noise power.}},

Contrary to homodyne detection, a heterodyne readout scheme can simultaneously measure more than one quadrature of the output field, providing an additional way of optimizing the interferometer sensitivity, but at the price of additional noise. Our analysis provides the framework needed to evaluate whether a homodyne or heterodyne readout scheme is more optimal for second generation interferometers from an astrophysical point of view.

The performance regarding interferometric sensing and control of the  LG 33  mode is found to be similar, if not even better in all aspects of interest. In addition, we evaluate the sensitivity gain of the implementation of  LG 33  modes into the Advanced Virgo instrument.

@article{Meers1988Recycling,
    abstract = {{Laser interferometers may detect gravitational waves by sensing the strain in space produced by their passage. The resultant change in intensity of an interference fringe must be observable against a background noise due to the statistical fluctuations in the number of detected photons. Optimization of the detector sensitivity thus involves devising an optical system which both maximizes the signal and minimizes the noise. This is attempted in the various arrangements known collectively as light recycling. Here, the performance of these systems is quantitatively assessed. Standard or broadband recycling functions essentially by making efficient use of the available light, but it is shown that it may also be made to further enhance the sensitivity within a narrow bandwidth, becoming tuned recycling. This works, as do all the narrow-band variants, by arranging for both the laser light and a gravitational-wave-induced sideband to be resonant in the optical system. The original narrow-band system, resonant recycling, can also be made broadband; the various sensitivity-bandwidth combinations, together with the tuning properties of such a system, are discussed.Furthermore, a new optical arrangement, dual recycling, is proposed. Its optical layout is an extension of standard recycling and its strength lies in its flexibility. It is shown that, relatively simply, it may be made into either a broadband or a narrow-band system, in each case with the same performance as the best of the other schemes. It may be tuned more efficiently and easily over a wide range of frequencies. Uniquely, optimum performance may be obtained with dual recycling without the requirement that the storage time of the optical elements in each arm of the interferometer be comparable with the period of the gravitational wave. This may allow the operation of delay line interferometers down to much lower gravitational-wave frequency and will provide great operational flexibility. Finally, it is shown that dual recycling, together with resonant recycling, is relatively insensitive to imperfections in the geometrical quality of the optical system. When implemented on interferometers with lengths greater than about a kilometer, recycling should allow the attainment of the sensitivity required in order to observe gravitational waves and open up a new window to the Universe.}},

Measurements of the relative fluctuations of the light power at three different ports of the main interferometer are presented. In addition, measurements and simulations of the coupling transfer functions from power fluctuations at the input laser to these ports are shown. The transfer function from the input laser to the output port of the interferometer is found to be non-trivial. Despite this, the numerical simulation produces an excellent match to it and gives insight to the mechanisms leading to the complicated shape. Furthermore, the coupling transfer functions of power fluctuations to the main (heterodyne) detector outputs are measured and simulated. These are used to evaluate the level with which laser power fluctuations contribute to the overall noise level of the instrument.}},

B1913+16. Together with the Keplerian orbital parameters, measurements of the
relativistic periastron advance and a combination of gravitational redshift and
time dilation yield the stellar masses with high accuracy. The measured rate of
change of orbital period agrees with that expected from the emission of
gravitational radiation, according to general relativity, to within about 0.2
percent. Systematic effects depending on the pulsar distance and on poorly
known galactic constants now dominate the error budget, so tighter bounds will
be difficult to obtain. Geodetic precession of the pulsar spin axis leads to
secular changes in pulse shape as the pulsar-observer geometry changes. This
effect makes it possible to model the two-dimensional structure of the beam. We
find that the beam is elongated in the latitude direction and appears to be
pinched in longitude near its center.}},

An exact computation of the antenna response is given in a form that is also suitable to provide directly the responses for simplier optical configurations without the power or the signal recycling. Furthermore the response of the antenna for the narrow-band detection mode is also calculated. The results obtained in the FNC gauge at rest with the antenna are consistent with the ones given in the literature that were computed in the transverse traceless gauge at rest with the gravitational radiation.}},

We used a diffractive optic and a mode-cleaner cavity to convert a fundamental LG00 Gaussian beam into an LG33 mode with a purity of 98\%. The ratio between the power of the LG00 mode of our laser and the power of the LG33 transmitted by the cavity was 36\%. By measuring the transmission of our setup using the LG00, we inferred that the conversion efficiency specific to the LG33 mode was 49\%. We illuminated a Michelson interferometer with the LG33 beam and achieved a visibility of 97\%.}},

These effects play an important role in next-generation gravitational wave detectors, as well as in quantum nondemolition interferometers. We measure the properties of an optical spring, created by coupling of an intense laser field to the pendulum mode of a suspended mirror, and also the parametric instability (PI) that arises from the coupling between acoustic modes of the cavity mirrors and the cavity optical mode. We measure an unprecedented optical rigidity of K=(3.08±0.09)×104 N∕m, corresponding to an optical rigidity that is 6000 times stiffer than the mechanical stiffness, and PI strength R≈3. We measure the unstable nature of the optical spring resonance, and demonstrate that the PI can be stabilized by feedback to the frequency of the laser source.}},

The search focused on signals from binary mergers with a total mass between 2 and 35M⊙. No gravitational waves are identified. The cumulative 90\%-confidence upper limits on the rate of compact binary coalescence are calculated for nonspinning binary neutron stars, black hole-neutron star systems, and binary black holes to be 8.7×10-3  yr-1 L10-1, 2.2×10-3  yr-1 L10-1, and 4.4×10-4  yr-1 L10-1, respectively, where L10 is 1010 times the blue solar luminosity.

    abstract = {{We present a search for periodic gravitational waves from the neutron star in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. The search coherently analyzes data in a 12 day interval taken from the fifth science run of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. It searches gravitational-wave frequencies from 100 to 300 Hz and covers a wide range of first and second frequency derivatives appropriate for the age of the remnant and for different spin-down mechanisms. No gravitational-wave signal was detected. Within the range of search frequencies, we set 95\% confidence upper limits of (0.7-1.2) × 10 –24  on the intrinsic gravitational-wave strain, (0.4-4) × 10 –4  on the equatorial ellipticity of the neutron star, and 0.005-0.14 on the amplitude of  r -mode oscillations of the neutron star. These direct upper limits beat indirect limits derived from energy conservation and enter the range of theoretical predictions involving crystalline exotic matter or runaway  r -modes. This paper is also the first gravitational-wave search to present upper limits on the  r -mode amplitude.}},

@article{Abbott2009Observation,
    abstract = {{We introduce a novel cooling technique capable of approaching the quantum ground state of a kilogram-scale system—an interferometric gravitational wave detector. The detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) operate within a factor of 10 of the standard quantum limit (SQL), providing a displacement sensitivity of 10 −18  m in a 100 Hz band centered on 150 Hz. With a new feedback strategy, we dynamically shift the resonant frequency of a 2.7 kg pendulum mode to lie within this optimal band, where its effective temperature falls as low as 1.4 μK, and its occupation number reaches about 200 quanta. This work shows how the exquisite sensitivity necessary to detect gravitational waves can be made available to probe the validity of quantum mechanics on an enormous mass scale.}},

    abstract = {{We discuss the limitations placed upon the sensitivity of laser-interferometric gravitational-wave detectors by imperfections in the shape or alignment of the optics, for various different detector configurations. Wave-front distortion is seen to be a serious problem for interferometers which recycle only the light power. We suggest that the use of dual recycling can confer greater tolerance of distortion, and therefore better gravitational-wave sensitivity, upon an interferometer. This suggestion is backed up with results from an experimental implementation of dual recycling. However, in its simple form, dual recycling only helps significantly when the signal bandwidth is narrowed. We propose a new optical arrangement, dual recycling with a compound mirror, which gives greater tolerance of distortion without restricting the bandwidth. This may improve the sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors by a factor as high as 5, while at the same time improving their operational flexibility.}},

LIGO will support studies concerning the nature and nonlinear dynamics of gravity, the structures of black holes, and the equation of state of nuclear matter. It will also measure the masses, birth rates, collisions, and distributions of black holes and neutron stars in the universe and probe the cores of supernovae and the very early universe. The technology for LIGO has been developed during the past 20 years. Construction will begin in 1992, and under the present schedule, LIGO's gravitational-wave searches will begin in 1998.}},

Numerical simulations show an increased sensitivity between 125 and 400 Hz, with a maximal improvement of about 80\% around 225 Hz, while the sensitivity above 400 Hz is decreased. Furthermore, our concept is found to give a sensitivity similar to that of a conventional RSE configuration with a signal-recycling mirror of moderate reflectivity. In the near future detuned arm cavities might be a beneficial alternative to RSE, due to the potentially less hardware-intensive implementation of the proposed concept.}},

The technique employs two frequency-offset laser fields to simultaneously create a stiff optical restoring force and a viscous optical damping force. We show how these forces may be used to optically trap a free mass without introducing thermal noise, and we demonstrate the technique experimentally with a 1 g mirror. The observed optical spring has an inferred Young's modulus of 1.2 TPa, 20\% stiffer than diamond. The trap is intrinsically cold and reaches an effective temperature of 0.8 K, limited by technical noise in our apparatus.}},

Here, we present the first experimental characterization of this setup as well as a detailed description of its optical layout. A squeezed quantum noise of up to 9 dB below the shot-noise level was observed in the detection band between 10 Hz and 10 kHz. We also present an analysis of the optical loss in our experiment and provide an estimation of the possible non-classical sensitivity improvement of the future squeezed light enhanced GEO 600 detector.}},

@article{Niebauer1991Nonstationary,
    abstract = {{We treat the shot noise of a light source modulated in power as a nonstationary random process. The spectrum of such modulated shot noise, although it is still white, is shown to contain correlations between different frequency components. In addition, the noise is not equally distributed in phase. These effects can deteriorate the shot-noise-limited sensitivity of modulated interferometers. Maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) introduces constraints on both the modulation and demodulation waveforms. The sensitivities obtained with several commonly used modulation schemes are calculated, and new modulation strategies are proposed to realize good SNR. We apply the results to the case of laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors where it is essential to reach a shot-noise-limited sensitivity. By taking into account the additional noise contribution from the modulated shot noise, we reduce the 3-dB discrepancy between the measured sensitivity of the Garching prototype detector and the theoretical shot-noise limit to about 1.5 dB.}},

The key property of a two-photon device is that it excites pairs of output modes independently. Thus our new formalism deals with two modes at a time; a continuum multimode description can be built by integrating over independently excited pairs of modes. For a pair of modes at frequencies  Ω±ε , we define (i)  quadrature-phase amplitudes,  which are complex-amplitude operators for modulation at frequency  ε  of waves ''cos[Ω(t-x/c)]'' and ''sin[Ω(t-x/c)]'' and (ii)  two-mode squeezed states,  which are the output states of an ideal two-photon device. The quadrature-phase amplitudes and the two-mode squeezed states serve as the building blocks for our formalism; their properties and their physical interpretation are extensively investigated.}},

@article{Caves1981Quantummechanical,
    abstract = {{The interferometers now being developed to detect gravitational waves work by measuring the relative positions of widely separated masses. Two fundamental sources of quantum-mechanical noise determine the sensitivity of such an interferometer: (i) fluctuations in number of output photons (photon-counting error) and (ii) fluctuations in radiation pressure on the masses (radiation-pressure error). Because of the low power of available continuous-wave lasers, the sensitivity of currently planned interferometers will be limited by photon-counting error. This paper presents an analysis of the two types of quantum-mechanical noise, and it proposes a new technique—the "squeezed-state" technique—that allows one to decrease the photon-counting error while increasing the radiation-pressure error, or vice versa. The key requirement of the squeezed-state technique is that the state of the light entering the interferometer's normally unused input port must be not the vacuum, as in a standard interferometer, but rather a "squeezed state"—a state whose uncertainties in the two quadrature phases are unequal. Squeezed states can be generated by a variety of nonlinear optical processes, including degenerate parametric amplification.}},

    abstract = {{The sensitivity of next-generation gravitational-wave detectors such as Advanced LIGO and LCGT should be limited mostly by quantum noise with an expected technical progress to reduce seismic noise and thermal noise. Those detectors will employ the optical configuration of resonant-sideband-extraction that can be realized with a signal-recycling mirror added to the Fabry-Perot Michelson interferometer. While this configuration can reduce quantum noise of the detector, it can possibly increase laser frequency noise and intensity noise. The analysis of laser noise in the interferometer with the conventional configuration has been done in several papers, and we shall extend the analysis to the resonant-sideband-extraction configuration with the radiation-pressure effect included. We shall also refer to laser noise in the case we employ the so-called DC readout scheme.}},

The initial LIGO detectors have finished a two-year long data run during which a full year of triple-coincidence data was collected at design sensitivity. Much of this run was also coincident with the data runs of interferometers in Europe, GEO600 and Virgo. The joint analysis of data from this international network of detectors is ongoing. No gravitational wave signals have been detected in analyses completed to date. Currently two of the LIGO detectors are being upgraded to increase their sensitivity in a program called Enhanced LIGO. The Enhanced LIGO detectors will start another roughly one-year long data run with increased sensitivity in 2009. In parallel, construction of Advanced LIGO, a major upgrade to LIGO, has begun. Installation and commissioning of Advanced LIGO hardware at the LIGO sites will commence at the end of the Enhanced LIGO data run in 2011. When fully commissioned, the Advanced LIGO detectors will be ten times as sensitive as the initial LIGO detectors. Advanced LIGO is expected to make several gravitational-wave detections per year.}},

The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) operates three kilometer- scale interferometric gravitational wave detectors at two sites: two in Hanford, WA and one in Livingston, LA. A significant upgrade, called Advanced LIGO, is planned for these detectors. The core work of this thesis involves using a 40m prototype interferometer on the Caltech campus to study length and sensing and control techniques for Advanced LIGO. The principal results are the development of a lock acquisition protocol for an advanced detector and a comparison of noise couplings between two gravitational wave signal extraction techniques, called RF and DC readout. 
In addition, a search in LIGO data was carried out for broadband, long- duration stochastic gravitational waves emitted from point sources. The results of this search are presented.}},

Part of the transition will be the move from a heterodyne readout to a DC readout scheme.   DC readout performance will be limited by higher order optical modes and control sidebands present at the output port. For optimum performance of DC readout an output mode cleaner (OMC) will clean the output beam of these contributions.   Inclusion of an OMC will introduce new noise sources whose magnitudes needed to be estimated and for which new control systems will be needed.

However, the experience in the currently running interferometers reveals several problems connected with a heterodyne readout, of which phase noise of the RF modulation is the most serious one. A homodyne detection scheme (DC-readout), using the highly stabilized and filtered carrier light as a local oscillator for the readout, is considered to be a favourable alternative. Recently a DC-readout scheme has been implemented on the GEO 600 detector. We describe the results of first measurements and give a comparison of the performance achieved with homodyne and heterodyne readout. The implications of the combined use of DC-readout and signal recycling are considered.}},

LIGO, a joint Caltech-MIT project supported by the National Science Foundation, operates three multi-kilometer interferometers at two widely separated sites in the United States. These detectors are the result of decades of worldwide technology development, design, construction and commissioning.

With this unprecedented sensitivity, the data are being analyzed to detect or place limits on GWs from a variety of potential astrophysical sources.}},

@article{Forward1978Wideband,
    abstract = {{A wideband laser-interferometer gravitational-radiation antenna was constructed and used to search for gravitational radiation in the frequency band from 1 to 20 kHz. The antenna consisted of a Michelson interferometer with the beamsplitter and retroreflectors attached to masses on soft suspensions that allowed essentially free motion above the suspension frequencies. The strains in the gravitational radiation produce a differential path length change in the two arms of the interferometer which is detected by a pair of balanced photodetectors. The interferometer used a folded-path configuration with an effective length of 8.5 m. The sensitivity of the interferometer was calibrated with signals from a piezoelectric displacement transducer. The strain noise in a 1-Hz bandwidth was less than 0.3 fm/m from 1 to 3 kHz; and less than 0.1 fm/m above 3 kHz; where it was essentially photon-noise limited. (For comparison; the  kT  strain noise in a room-temperature; 2-m long; 1000-kg; elastic solid bar antenna is 0.14 fm/m.) The laser interferometer was operated as a detector for gravitational radiation for 150 h during the nights and weekends from the period 4 October through 3 December 1972. During the same period; bar antennas were operated by the Maryland; Glasgow; and Frascati groups; with 18 events reported by the Frascati group in their single bar; 22 single-bar events and no coincidences reported by the Glasgow group in their two bars; and 28 coincidences reported by the Maryland group between the Argonne bar and the Maryland bar and/or disk antennas. The various bar antenna systems were quite different but in general were sensitive to gravitational-radiation strain spectral components with an amplitude of the order of 0.1 fm/m in a narrow band of frequencies about the resonant frequency of the bar. The wideband interferometer data was analyzed by ear; with the detection sensitivity estimated to be of the order of 1-10 fm/m (depending upon the signature of the signal) for the total of the gravitational-radiation strain spectral components in the band from 1-20 kHz. No significant correlations between the Malibu interferometer output and any of the bar events or coincidences were observed.}},

High sensitivity for detection of resonance information is achieved by optical heterodyne detection with sidebands produced by rf phase modulation. Physical, optical, and electronic aspects of this discriminator/laser frequency stabilization system are considered in detail. We show that a high-speed domain exists in which the system responds to the phase (rather than frequency) change of the laser; thus with suitable design the servo loop bandwidth is not limited by the cavity response time. We report diagnostic experiments in which a dye laser and gas laser were independently locked to one stable cavity. Because of the precautions employed, the observed sub-100 Hz beat line width shows that the lasers were this stable. Applications of this system of laser stabilization include precision laser spectroscopy and interferometric gravity-wave detectors.}},

@phdthesis{Rakhmanov2000Dynamics,
    abstract = {{This thesis is a study of dynamics of the new laser gravitational-wave detectors.
The analysis in the thesis is developed primarily for LIGO (Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory) but can be used for other interferometers such
as VIRGO and TAMA. The dynamics of fields in the interferometers are described
in terms of difference equations which take into account the light transit time in
the arm cavities. Solutions for these equations are found in the transient and
steady-state regimes. In particular, a matrix technique is introduced to analyze
the dynamics of fields in a three-mirror coupled cavity. The dynamics of mirrors in
the interferometer are described in terms of nonlinear differential equations with
delays. The mirrors interact with each other through the light circulating in the in-
terferometer. This interaction gives rise to instabilities which lead to violations of
the energy conservation. The instabilities and the associated energy transfers are
studied using both analytical methods and numerical simulations. The dynamics
of interferometers are described in terms of the time-domain difference equations.
Linear transfer functions representing the basic interferometer responses are found
by solving the time-domain equations for different special cases. The main param-
eters for these transfer functions, the poles and zeros, are found as functions of
the mirror reflectivities. Finally, the dynamic response of the interferometers to
gravitational waves is described. The response function includes the forces acting
on the mirrors, the delays in the interferometer arm cavities, and the gravitational
red-shift of light. Optimization of this response suggests a possibility of resonant
detection of gravitational waves which can significantly increase the sensitivity of
the interferometers in a narrow band.}},

@article{Rakhmanov2008Highfrequency,
    abstract = {{Searches for gravitational waves with km-scale laser interferometers often involve the long-wavelength approximation to describe the detector response. The prevailing assumption is that the corrections to the detector response due to its finite size are small and the errors due to the long-wavelength approximation are negligible. Recently, however, Baskaran and Grishchuk (2004 Class. Quantum Grav. 21 4041) found that in a simple Michelson interferometer such errors can be as large as 10\%. For more accurate analysis, these authors proposed to use a linear-frequency correction to the long-wavelength approximation. In this paper we revisit these calculations. We show that the linear-frequency correction is inadequate for certain locations in the sky and therefore accurate analysis requires taking into account the exact formula, commonly derived from the photon round-trip propagation time. Also, we extend the calculations to include the effect of Fabry-Perot resonators in the interferometer arms. Here we show that a simple approximation which combines the long-wavelength Michelson response with the single-pole approximation to the Fabry-Perot transfer function produces rather accurate results. In particular, the difference between the exact and the approximate formulae is at most 2-3\% for those locations in the sky where the detector response is greater than half of its maximum value. We analyse the impact of such errors on detection sensitivity and parameter estimation in searches for periodic gravitational waves emitted by a known pulsar, and in searches for an isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background. At frequencies up to 1 kHz, the effect of such errors is at most 1-2\%. For higher frequencies, or if more accuracy is required, one should use the exact formula for the detector response.}},

@book{Sussman2001Structure,
    abstract = {{This textbook takes an innovative approach to the teaching of classical
mechanics, emphasizing the development of general but practical intellectual
tools to support the analysis of nonlinear Hamiltonian systems. The
development is organized around a progressively more sophisticated analysis of
particular natural systems and weaves examples throughout the presentation.
Explorations of phenomena such as transitions to chaos, nonlinear resonances,
and resonance overlap to help the student to develop appropriate analytic
tools for understanding. Computational algorithms communicate methods used in
the analysis of dynamical phenomena. Expressing the methods of mechanics in a
computer language forces them to be unambiguous and computationally effective.
Once formalized as a procedure, a mathematical idea also becomes a tool that
can be used directly to compute results. The student actively explores the
motion of systems through computer simulation and experiment. This active
exploration is extended to the mathematics. The requirement that the computer
be able to interpret any expression provides strict and immediate feedback as
to whether an expression is correctly formulated. The interaction with the
computer uncovers and corrects many deficiencies in understanding.}},

The primary mission of the prototype is to serve as an experimental testbed for upgrades to the LIGO interferometers and for gaining experience with advanced interferometric techniques, including detuned resonant sideband extraction (i.e. signal recycling) and dc readout (optical homodyne detection). The former technique will be employed in Advanced LIGO, and the latter in both Enhanced and Advanced LIGO. Using dc readout for gravitational wave signal extraction has several technical advantages, including reduced laser and oscillator noise couplings as well as reduced shot noise, when compared to the traditional rf readout technique (optical heterodyne detection) currently in use in large-scale ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors. The Caltech 40m laboratory is currently prototyping a dc readout system for a fully suspended interferometric gravitational wave detector.

@phdthesis{RanaThesis,
    abstract = {{Around the world, efforts are underway to commission several kilometer-scale laser interferometers to detect gravitational radiation. In the United States, there are two collocated interferometers in Hanford, Washington and one interferometer in Livingston, Louisiana. Together, these three interferometers form the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). The core of the work described in this thesis is the modeling and reduction of the noise in the interferometers which limits their ultimate sensitivity. A vital component of the noise reduction is the modeling, design, and implementation of [approximately]100 feedback control systems. The most critical of these systems are described and motivated. Although improvements are continuously being made to the stability and noise character of these detectors, several months of data have been collected. Various efforts are underway to search through these data for gravitational wave signals. Included here, is a description of a search made through the data for signals from the ringdown of the quasi-normal modes of Kerr black holes. In addition, several possible future improvements to the detectors are outlined.}},

systematically between 0.058967 and 0.059045 sec over a cycle of 0.3230
d. Approximately 200 independent observations over 5-minute intervals
have yielded a well-sampled velocity curve which implies a binary orbit
with projected semimajor axis sin i = 1.0 solar radius, eccentricity e =
0.615, and mass function f(m) = 0.13 solar mass. No eclipses are
observed. We infer that the unseen companion is a compact object with
mass comparable to that of the pulsar. In addition to the obvious
potential for determining the masses of the pulsar and its companion,
this discovery makes feasible a number of studies involving the physics
of compact objects, the astrophysics of close binary systems, and
special- and general-relativistic effects.}},

We show that a translation of the input axis or a mismatch of the beam waist to the resonator waist size causes a coupling of off-axis modes which is inphase with the input field. On the other hand, a tilt of the input beam or a mismatch of the beam waist position to cavity waist position couples to these modes in quadrature phase. We also propose a method to measure these coupling coefficients and thereby provide a means to align and mode-match a resonant optical cavity in real time.}},

In quantum mechanics the probability of an event which can happen in several different ways is the absolute square of a sum of complex contributions; one from each alternative way. The probability that a particle will be found to have a path  x ( t ) lying somewhere within a region of space time is the square of a sum of contributions; one from each path in the region. The contribution from a single path is postulated to be an exponential whose (imaginary) phase is the classical action (in units of ℏ) for the path in question. The total contribution from all paths reaching  x ;  t  from the past is the wave function ψ( x ;  t ). This is shown to satisfy Schroedinger's equation. The relation to matrix and operator algebra is discussed. Applications are indicated; in particular to eliminate the coordinates of the field oscillators from the equations of quantum electrodynamics.}},

Specifically we apply the iterative Gerchberg-Saxton-Fienup algorithm to simulated three-dimensional transmission electron diffraction data from monolayer organic crystals. We find that oversampling along the reciprocal-lattice rods (relrods) normal to the monolayer alone does not solve the phase problem in this geometry in general. However, based on simulations for a crystalline protein monolayer (lysozyme), we find that convergence is obtained in three dimensions if phases are supplied from a few high resolution electron microscope images recorded at small tilts to the beam direction. In the absence of noise, amplitude-weighted phase residuals of around 5 degrees, and a cross-correlation coefficient of 0.96 between the true and estimated potential are obtained if phases are included from images at tilts of up to 15 degrees. The performance is almost as good in the presence of noise at a level that is comparable to that commonly observed in electron crystallography of proteins. The method should greatly reduce the time and labor needed for data acquisition and analysis in cryo-electron microscopy of organic thin crystals by avoiding the need to record images at high tilt angles.}},

@article{AbuArish2004Threedimensional,
    abstract = {{Agrobacterium tumefaciens infects plant cells by a unique mechanism involving an interkingdom genetic transfer. A single-stranded DNA substrate is transported across the two cell walls along with the bacterial virulence proteins VirD2 and VirE2. A single VirD2 molecule covalently binds to the 5'-end of the single-stranded DNA, while the VirE2 protein binds stoichiometrically along the length of the DNA, without sequence specificity. An earlier transmission/scanning transmission electron microscopy study indicated a solenoidal ("telephone coil") organization of the VirE2-DNA complex. Here we report a three-dimensional reconstruction of this complex using electron microscopy and single-particle image-processing methods. We find a hollow helical structure of 15.7-nm outer diameter, with a helical rise of 51.5 nm and 4.25 VirE2 proteins/turn. The inner face of the protein units contains a continuous wall and an inward protruding shelf. These structures appear to accommodate the DNA binding. Such a quaternary arrangement naturally sequesters the DNA from cytoplasmic nucleases and suggests a mechanism for its nuclear import by decoration with host cell factors. Coexisting with the helices, we also found VirE2 tetrameric ring structures. A two-dimensional average of the latter confirms the major features of the three-dimensional reconstruction. 10.1074/jbc.M401804200}},

@article{Allen1999Detecting,
    abstract = {{We analyze the signal processing required for the optimal detection of a stochastic background of gravitational radiation using laser interferometric detectors. Starting with basic assumptions about the statistical properties of a stochastic gravity-wave background; we derive expressions for the optimal filter function and signal-to-noise ratio for the cross-correlation of the outputs of two gravity-wave detectors. Sensitivity levels required for detection are then calculated. Issues related to (i) calculating the signal-to-noise ratio for arbitrarily large stochastic backgrounds; (ii) performing the data analysis in the presence of nonstationary detector noise; (iii) combining data from multiple detector pairs to increase the sensitivity of a stochastic background search; (iv) correlating the outputs of 4 or more detectors; and (v) allowing for the possibility of correlated noise in the outputs of two detectors are discussed. We briefly describe a computer simulation that was used to \^{a}experimentally\^{a} verify the theoretical calculations derived in the paper; and which mimics the generation and detection of a simulated stochastic gravity-wave signal in the presence of simulated detector noise. Numerous graphs and tables of numerical data for the five major interferometers (LIGO-WA; LIGO-LA; VIRGO; GEO-600; and TAMA-300) are also given. This information consists of graphs of the noise power spectra; overlap reduction functions; and optimal filter functions; also included are tables of the signal-to-noise ratios and sensitivity levels for cross-correlation measurements between different detector pairs. The treatment given in this paper should be accessible to both theorists involved in data analysis and experimentalists involved in detector design and data acquisition.}},
